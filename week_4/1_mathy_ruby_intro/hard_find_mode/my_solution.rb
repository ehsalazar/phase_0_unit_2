# U2.W4: Calculate the mode!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

# Write a method `mode` which takes an `Array` of numbers or strings as its input and returns an `Array` of the most frequent values.
# If there's only one most-frequent value, it returns a single-element `Array`.

# Define the mode method with (array) as its parameter.
