# U2.W4: Calculate the mode!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

# Write a method `mode` which takes an `Array` of numbers or strings as its input and returns an `Array` of the most frequent values.
# If there's only one most-frequent value, it returns a single-element `Array`.

# Define the mode method with (array) as its parameter.
#   Create count as a new Hash set to 0
#   Loop through the array using the each method and do |index|
#     count[index] is equal to count[index] plus 1
#   End loop
#   Create mode_array set equal to an empty array.
#   Loop through the count hash using the each method and do |key, value|
#     If the value is equal to the count values max
#       Shovel the key into the mode_array
#     End if statement
#   End loop
#   Output the mode_array sorted by highest occurance.
# End method
