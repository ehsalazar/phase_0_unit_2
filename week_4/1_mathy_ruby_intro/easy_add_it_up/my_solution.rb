# U2.W4: Add it up!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge by myself.

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

# Write a method `total` which takes an `Array` of numbers as its input and returns their total (sum).
# Define the total method with (Array) as its parameter.
# Set sum equal to 0.
# Iterate through Array using the each method passing a block {|index| sum is equal to sum plus index}
# Output the sum.
# End the method.
